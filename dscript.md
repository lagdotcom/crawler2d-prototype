# DScript Design

## Types

- `number`, can be float or int doesn't matter we're using js after all
- `string` delimited with " (or '?) in code
- `bool` can be `true` or `false`, comparison operators produce these

## Expressions

All the boring normal stuff:

- `+ - * / ^` for arithmetic
- `and or` for short-circuiting boolean logic
- `xor` for boolean logic
- `== != > >= < <=` for comparison
- unary `-` for negation
- unary `not` for boolean negation
